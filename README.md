# 🌤️ Real-Time Weather Event Notification System using Pub/Sub

This project implements a highly scalable and fault-tolerant real-time weather notification system using a distributed Pub/Sub architecture on AWS EC2.

## 🚀 Features

- **Scalable Architecture**: Utilizes AWS EC2 instances to handle high volumes of data and user requests.
- **Optimized Message Brokering**: Ensures low latency and high throughput for real-time notifications.
- **Leader Election**: Implements leader election algorithms for effective node coordination and fault tolerance.
- **Heartbeat Protocols**: Monitors node health to maintain system reliability and availability.
- **Personalized Alerts**: Delivers weather notifications based on geographic and user preferences.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **AWS EC2**: For scalable infrastructure.
- **Java**: Backend development.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user and message data.
- **Distributed Systems Principles**: Leader election, heartbeat protocols, message brokering.
